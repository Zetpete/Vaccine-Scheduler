# Vaccine-Scheduler
A simulation of registering for a COVID-19 vaccine appointment. It already includes the 3 main vaccines (J&amp;J, Pfizer, Moderna), but caregivers can create new ones. This project was created mainly to enchance my learning of database applications including using SQL in java with ER diagrams, data normalization, and SQL queries / updates.
